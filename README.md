[00:00.13] One, two, three, four
[00:10.63] 
[01:21.32] I would say I'm sorry if I thought that it would change your mind
[01:27.24] But I know that this time I have said too much, been too unkind
[01:58.74] 
[01:33.40] I tried to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies
[01:38.60] I tried to laugh about it, hidin' the tears in my eyes
[01:43.91] 'Cause boys don't cry
[01:49.82] Boys don't cry
[01:56.82] 
[01:55.83] I would break down at your feet and beg forgiveness, plead with you
[02:01.49] But I know that it's too late and now there's nothing I can do
[02:32.49] 
[02:18.68] Boys
[02:24.17] Boys don't cry
[02:31.17] 
[02:52.95] I would break down at your feet and beg forgiveness, plead with you
[02:58.40] But I know that it's too late and now there's nothing I can do
[03:29.40] 
[03:04.53] So I tried to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies
[03:10.24] I tried to laugh about it, hidin' the tears in my eyes
[03:15.56] 'Cause boys don't cry
[03:21.39] Boys don't cry
[03:28.39] 
[03:27.18] I would tell you that I loved you if I thought that you would stay
[03:32.60] But I know that it's no use, that you've already gone away
[04:01.60] 
[03:38.79] Misjudged your limit
[03:41.56] Pushed you too far
[03:44.34] Took you for granted
[03:46.69] I thought that you needed me more
[04:03.19] 
[04:18.49] Boys don't cry
[04:30.04] Boys don't cry
[04:37.04] 
[04:36.30] Misjudged your limit
[04:39.16] Pushed you too far
[04:41.99] Took you for granted
[04:44.27] I thought that you needed me more
[05:00.77] 
[04:47.09] Now I would do most anything to get you back by my side
[04:52.75] But I just keep on laughin' hidin' the tears in my eyes
[04:58.41] 'Cause boys don't cry
[05:04.31] Boys don't cry
[05:11.31] 
[05:12.49] Boys don't cry
